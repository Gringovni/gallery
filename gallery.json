Jewelry is sculptural and metallic, catching highlights subtly without overpowering the composition. The background is minimal and tonal, designed to support the subject rather than compete with it. Lighting is soft and directional, shaping the face gently while preserving shadow detail. The overall image feels tactile, intentional, and editorial, with restrained contrast and a calm cinematic mood.\nMODEL: FLUX.2 Klein"
